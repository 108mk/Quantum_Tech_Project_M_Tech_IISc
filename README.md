# Quantum_Tech_Project_M_Tech_IISc
This repository contains my current research work in Quantum technology. My primary interest is in knowing "WHY" and "WHERE" Quantum-ness can be used as a resource in computation. 
## Phase-I (August-October '23): Review of Quantum algorithms
⭐ Quantum Complexity Theory (QCT)
> Paper reviews
>> Forrelation: A problem that optimally separates quantum and classical computation [Aaronson-Ambianis 2015]
>>
>> Oracle separation of BQP and PH(Polynomial Hierarchy) [Raz-Tal 2018]
>> 
>> Verifiable Qauntum Advantage without structure [Yamakawa-Zhandry 2022]
>> 
⭐ Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSA)
> Paper reviews
>> Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Dissipative Nonlinear Differential Equation [Jin-Peng Liu,..., Andrew Childs 2021]
>>
>> Towards provably efficient Quantum algorithms for large-scale Machine-learning models [Pre-print: JunyuLiu,.., Liang Jiang 2023]

## Phase-II (November- December 23): Research Proposal with exact problem Statement 
> Drafting the problem statement with a tentative roadmap to approach it.
>
> Approval from the advisor and M.Tech project committee.

## Phase-III (January- June 24): Working on the Proposal.
> ... (to be updated in due date)
