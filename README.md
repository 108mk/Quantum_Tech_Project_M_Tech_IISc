# Quantum_Tech_Project_M_Tech_IISc
This repository contains my current research on quantum technology. My primary interest is in knowing "WHY" and "WHERE" Quantum-ness can be used as a resource in computation.

The core research theme that I aim to touch on is:

1. Quantum for Quantum: Simulating Quantum systems via quantum algorithms has been long considered since the 80s (due to Y. Manin and R. Feynman).
  
2. Quantum for Classical: "How efficient can it be to simulate classical systems via quantum algorithms?" There are numerous classical systems of academic and industrial importance. It remains to be seen how helpful quantum algorithmic paradigms could be.

## Phase-II (December 23): Research Proposal with exact problem Statement 
> Exploring some possibilities to enhance the computational complexity of the quantum algorithm for the Reaction-Diffusion System proposed by Costa et al (2023).
> We hypothesise there is some room for improvement if we replace the truncated Taylor series employed by Costa et al (2023) with a Chebyshev series-based method.
